        <h2>The Proud King and the Squirrel</h2>

        <p>
        Once upon a time, there was a king who was very proud 
        of his matchless position. He was young and intelligent...
        </p>

        <div class="hidden-content">
            <p>
            The king believed he was superior to everyone.
            But a tiny squirrel began mocking him, chanting verses
            about wealth and pride. Furious, the king tried to
            silence the squirrel, yet failed each time.
            Finally, he learned the wisdom of ignoring vanity.

        <h2>The Whisper</h2>

        <p>
        In a small village lived two boys — Raghu and Raju.
        One was honest and humble, the other clever but dishonest...
        </p>

        <div class="hidden-content">
            <p>
            Years later, Raju became Prime Minister through
            deceit. Raghu, disguised, exposed corruption
            through a clever plan involving whispers and gold.
            The King realized truth and justice prevailed.
